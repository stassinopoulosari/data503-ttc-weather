# DATA503 Final Project (Final)

**Ari Stassinopoulos** apstassinopoulos@willamette.edu

This repository contains the code for the final attempt at my DATA503 final project. The aim of this code was to use TTC and OpenWeather data to
determine the extent to which the delay seen in TTC streetcars was attributable to the weather.

This is designed to be used with Heroku's PostgreSQL, but you can also expose

```shell
DATABASE_URL='postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME'
PORT= # Port to expose
```

environment variables.
